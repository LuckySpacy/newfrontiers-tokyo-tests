This example was created only to show the abilities of the
QuickRTTI component to save an object containing lists and subobjects to an
XML file and to retrieve the object from that file. I'm convinced that
this XML-aware objects will leave an important mark in the Delphi Community. 
In my opinion the fields of application have a very wide range and the component deserves a very special attention from the Delphi programmers.  
Thank you Mike for the hours of programming you've dedicated to this useful component. 

The demo itself it's only a first, semi-serious attempt to develop a Dynamic Object Model framework in Delphi. The goal is to create a framework in Delphi where the end user of a program would be able to create new classes of objects with different attributes without the need of programming, from which the users can then create the concrete instances. There is an immense bibliography on the subject, mainly from the work of Prof.Ralph Johnson who wrote some interesting articles explaining the framework in terms of a combination of different Design Patterns. Who knows, maybe someday I'll be able to came up with some useful code in Object Pascal. Please let me know if you find it interesting, if you have some suggestions or if you would like to have a list of articles on the subject. I would appreciate very much to receive some information about some successful applications of a similar framework with the use of Delphi.
